### Backwards-incompatible changes

- `SquarebotSlackMessageValue` no longer includes a `bot_id` field. Instead, the `user` field is set to the bot's ID and a new `is_bot` field indicates if the `user` field is a bot or user ID.

### New features

- Add support for Slack messages with `subtype` of `bot_message`. This is implemented in the Slack message model `SlackMessageEventContent` as a new `subtype` field that now takes a `SlackMessageSubtype` enum. The Kafka representation of this message, `SquarebotSlackMessageValue` has been updated to now set the `user` attribute to either the user's ID or the bot's ID as appropriate. A new flag, `is_bot` indicates if the `user` field reflects a user or bot (app integration) identifier.
