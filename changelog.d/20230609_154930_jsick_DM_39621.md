### Bug fixes

- Fix type annotations related in `channel_type` in `rubin.squarebot.models.kafka.SquarebotSlackMessageValue`. We now assure that the channel type is not Null here. However the `channel_type` field is now set to null/None in the `SquarebotSlackAppMentionValue` model.

### Other changes

- Switched to [nox](https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/) for running tests and repository tasks. Nox now replaces the two tox configurations for the client and server. Nox also replaces the `Makefile` for repository tasks:
  - `nox -s venv-init` initializes a Python venv virtual environment and installs the application into it. Alternatively, `nox -s init` can be used to initialize the application in the current Python environment (like `make init`).
  - `nox -s update-deps` updates the pinned dependencies as well as the pre-commit hooks (replacing `make update-deps`).
- New nox integration with scriv for change log management: `nox -s scriv-create` creates a change log fragment and `nox -s scriv-collect X.Y.Z` collects change log fragments into CHANGELOG.md for a release.
