### Backwards-incompatible changes

- sqrbot-jr is now Squarebot. It's docker image is now published at `ghcr.io/lsst-sqre/squarebot`. The app is also deployed through a Helm chart in [lsst-sqre/phalanx](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/phalanx), rather than as a Kustomize manifest. See _New features_ for more details.
- Avro schemas for messages
- Slack interaction events are currently unsupported; only Slack messages are published to Kafka.

### New features

- Squarebot is rebuilt for the modern SQuaRE app architecture: FastAPI, deployed with Helm through Phalanx.
- Squarebot uses Pydantic for modelling Avro-encoded Kafka messages. This allows for end-to-end type checking from the HTTP handlers to the messages published to Kafka.
- The `lsst-sqre/squarebot` repository is now a monorepo that contains the Squarebot service and a client library (`rubin-squarebot` on PyPI). The client library contains Pydantic models for the Avro-encoded messages published to Kafka by Squarebot. See [SQR-075](https://sqr-075.lsst.io) for details on the monorepo architecture and [SQR-076](https://sqr-076.lsst.io) background on how Pydantic is used for Kafka message modelling.
